### Minor Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/pull/13) [`31acda3`](https://github.com/azero-id/resolver/commit/31acda37409cdd945fa12669bac364e3eb312990) Thanks [@wottpal](https://github.com/wottpal)! - Add `customApi` to `ResolveOptions` to allow for a custom `ApiPromise` instance, instead of creating a new default one. This approach is way more performant and memory efficient, if you have an already existing `ApiPromise` anyways. â€“ Make sure to always initialize the chain and rpc correctly, though.
